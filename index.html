     <p class="akan-briefs">Akan, ethnolinguistic grouping of peoples of the Guinea Coast who speak Akan languages (of the Kwa branch of the Niger-Congo family). They include the speakers of the Akyem, Anyi, Asante (Ashanti), Attié, Baule, Brong, Chakosi, Fante (Fanti), and Guang languages; some scholars also consider Twi a distinct Akan language. Most Akan peoples live in Ghana, where they settled in successive waves of migration between the 11th and 18th centuries; others inhabit the eastern part of Côte d’Ivoire and parts of Togo.
        Traditional Akan society is composed of exogamous matrilineal clans, the members of which trace their descent from a common female ancestor; these clans are hierarchically organized and are subdivided into localized matrilineages, which form the basic social and political units of Akan society

     <p id="naming-briefs">Akan names come from a traditional naming system for people from countries such as Togo, Ivory Coast and Ghana. 
        A child’s name is determined by factors surrounding his or her birth. For example, the day of their birth or the manner in which they were born may determine which name they get irrespective of their gender.
        it is automatic for a child to get a specific name depending on the day they were born according to the Akan tradition. 
        To add to that, the name is accompanied by certain appellations. The list below highlights all the popular names for both males and females from each day of the week and the accompanying appellations. </p>
